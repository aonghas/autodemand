-   [Getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting started

-   First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
-   Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
-   Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `watch`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!

## Deploying

When you're ready to deploy, use the `npm run build` command to build the files for deployment. Once this command is complete, the folder `dist` will be created. This folder can be copied into a SitePages folder on SharePoint for hosting.
